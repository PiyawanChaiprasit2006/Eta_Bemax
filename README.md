## ü§ñ Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a semi-autonomous robot capable of assisting individuals in medical need, particularly those unable to move or reach supplies themselves. Eta-Bemax is designed for lab settings with flat, unobstructed flooring, where it can provide emergency aid without requiring human assistance.

The robot addresses three common lab-related injuries:
   ‚Ä¢ Burns
   ‚Ä¢ Cuts
   ‚Ä¢ Eye infections

Each injury type corresponds to a dedicated compartment in the robot, stocked with the appropriate medical supplies. When a person is in need, they can say the wake word "help me." Upon detecting the wake word, the robot will activate its camera and object detection model to locate a human in the room. Once the human is centered in the frame, Eta-Bemax autonomously approaches the user. When it reaches a predefined proximity threshold, it stops and triggers all servo-controlled compartments to open.

In parallel, a Flask-based web app provides manual control of the robot‚Äôs movement and compartments. It also includes:
   ‚Ä¢ A directional control pad for movement
   ‚Ä¢ Real-time status updates and error logs
   ‚Ä¢ Toggle buttons to open/close compartments

## üì¶ Module Installation
To run Eta-Bemax, install the following dependencies:
pip install flask
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
pip install flask-login
pip install gpiozero
pip install pvporcupine
pip install speechrecognition
pip install opencv-python
pip install adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685

## üîß Guidelines
| Language   | Tools |
|------------|-------|
| Python     |[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/ ), [GPIOZero] (https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [PicoVoice] (https://picovoice.ai/platform/porcupine/), [OpenCV] (https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d0/de3/tutorial_py_intro.html)     |

## üé® Features
   ‚Ä¢ Custom Wake-Word Activation: Trained on ‚Äúhelp me‚Äù using PicoVoice.
   ‚Ä¢ Voice Commands: Supports ‚ÄúCome here‚Äù and ‚ÄúOpen compartments‚Äù with live speech-to-text.
   ‚Ä¢ Visual Human Detection: Rotates until a person is in view, then approaches and stops at a set distance.
   ‚Ä¢ Servo-Controlled Compartments: All open/close simultaneously to deliver supplies.
   ‚Ä¢ Web Admin Interface: Manual control, error logs, and dynamic toggle between open/closed states.
   ‚Ä¢ Automatic Timeout Logic: Stops rotation or compartment operation if no command is detected.

## üêæ Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory and run the Flask server: ```python3 app.py```
2. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000
